# R2D2_Face_Recognition
Created back in 2019, this is how R2-D2 was originally trained to recognize our family members

In order to use this code, you'll need to create folders called "dataset" and "output" in the root.  

Inside the dataset folder, you'll need to create a folder for each person or object you want to train to identify, named after the training output you want to show.  
In each of those folders you want to put at least a hundred photos, taken from many angles and lighting sources, using the scripts in the code.
