# R2D2 Face Recognition
This is how I originally trained my R2-D2 in a foundational model to recognize our family members, play peek-a-boo, and turn his head back and forth tracking people's movement.

You can see it in action in these videos:

In order to use this code, you'll need to create folders called "dataset" and "output" in the root.  

Inside the dataset folder, you'll need to create a folder for each person or object you want to train to identify, named after the training output you want to show.

In each of those dataset folders you want to put at least a hundred photos, taken from many angles and lighting sources, using the scripts in the code.

The output folder will have the output of the video feed as it detects people and draws bounding boxes around their faces.

This was created back in 2019.
